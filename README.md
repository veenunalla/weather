Weather Application
Overview
This Weather Application provides real-time weather updates using modern Android development tools and libraries. The app is built with Retrofit for network requests, Hilt for dependency injection, Jetpack Compose for UI, Navigation Component for navigation, and DataStore for data storage.

Features
Weather Updates: Fetches current weather data from a weather API when city is entered.
Weather Forecase : Shows forecast for next 5days.

Architecture
The app follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern, ensuring a clear separation of concerns and making the codebase more maintainable.

Libraries and Tools
Retrofit: For making network requests to the weather API.
Hilt: For dependency injection, simplifying the management of dependencies.
Jetpack Compose: For building the UI declaratively.
Navigation Component: For handling navigation between different screens.
DataStore: For storing user preferences and app data.
